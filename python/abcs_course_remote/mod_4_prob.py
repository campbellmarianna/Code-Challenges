Prompt:
Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.

# [x] Step 1
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found.

# [x] Step 2
Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

# [x] Step 3 - after the characters that are  digits are found, the first character you see that is not a digit stop checking and return the number 
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

# [x] Step 4 - Base case empty, all letters, whitespace, not numbers return Zero. Additionally if the first thing seen is not a integer do not perform conversion exit
If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

Note:
# [x] Step 5 - Now that you know you have all integers check to make sure it is within the 32 bit range, if it is output that number if it isn't output the INT_MIN to check take of the negative value. Use this `'{:032b}'.format(100)` to see the binary representation of the number if the len of the reprsentation is greater than 32 then it is not binary. If is 32 bit or less output the number however if it is not check if the first character is a negative sign if so output -2 ** 31 otherwise 2 ** 31.
Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

Example 1:
Input: "42"
Output: 42

Example 2:
Input: "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

Example 3:
Input: "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
Example 4:

Input: "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
Example 5:

Input: "-91283472332"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
             Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

'''
Prompt:
You are given an array A consisting of strings made up of the letters ‘a’ and ‘b’ only. 
Each string goes through a number of operations, where:
1.	At time 1, you circularly rotate each string by 1 letter.
2.	At time 2, you circularly rotate the new rotated strings by 2 letters.
3.	At time 3, you circularly rotate the new rotated strings by 3 letters.
4.	At time i, you circularly rotate the new rotated strings by i % length(string) letters.

Eg: String is "abaa"

1.	At time 1, string is "baaa", as 1 letter is circularly rotated to the back
2.	At time 2, string is "aaba", as 2 letters of the string "baaa" is circularly rotated to the back
3.	At time 3, string is "aaab", as 3 letters of the string "aaba" is circularly rotated to the back
4.	At time 4, string is again "aaab", as 4 letters of the string "aaab" is circularly rotated to the back
5.	At time 5, string is "aaba", as 1 letters of the string "aaab" is circularly rotated to the back

After some units of time, a string becomes equal to it’s original self. 
Once a string becomes equal to itself, it’s letters start to rotate from the first letter again (process resets). So, if a string takes t time to get back to the original, at time t+1 one letter will be rotated and the string will be it’s original self at 2t time. 
You have to find the minimum time, where maximum number of strings are equal to their original self. 

As this time can be very large, give the answer, modulo 10^9 +7.

Note: Your solution will run on multiple test cases so do clear global variables after using them.


Input:
A: Array of strings.

Output:
Minimum time, where maximum number of strings are equal to their original self.

Constraints:
1 <= size(A) <= 10^5
1 <= size of each string in A <= 10^5
Each string consists of only characters 'a' and 'b'
Summation of length of all strings <= 10^7

Example:

Input
A: [a,ababa,ab]

Output
4

String 'a' is it's original self at time 1, 2, 3 and 4.
String 'ababa' is it's original self only at time 4. (ababa => babaa => baaba => babaa => ababa)
String 'ab' is it's original self at time 3 and 4. (ab => ba => ba => ab => ab)

Hence, 3 strings are their original self at time 4.
