# Problem Solving Process & Strategy
# UMPIRE method overview
- **U**nderstand - clarify what the interviewer is asking for
    - ask questions
- **M**atch - Identify similar patterns and problems
    - think about other problems in the past that are similar
- **P**lan - Psudeocode an alorithm and prove it works
- **I**mplement - Write the code
    - put the plan in proper syntax
- **R**eview - Test your solution by walking through it
    - walk through it in your head
- **E**valuate - Analyze time and space complexity

The Big Take Away Here:
**Build understanding before you build anything else**

### Understand
Probelm: Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

- What is the prompt?
- What key actions do we need to take within the prompt? We are counting the prime numbers
    - Looking for the verb is going to help to understand the problem
- What is the input? n
- What data type is the input? 
- What is the output, exactly? Look at the key actions within the prompt. The number of prime numbers less than the key input.
- What data type is the ouput?
- What is the format of the ouput?
# What to do when your not sure where to start

### Match
Probelm: Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.
- Have you seen a problem like this before?
- What kinds of operations are involved in prime numbers?
    - Think about the problem I've had to solve about prime numbers
    - Think about the last time you had to solve the problem when you were taught how to solve it when you were younger
    - Determining Primality
    - Prime Factors
    - Remembering Primes
### Make a Plan
Probelm: Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.
Note: Prime Numbers are numbers only have to factors (2 numbers that can be multipled to equal the number) 1 and itself
- Learn what to do when you haven't seen a problem before
- Determine the answer by creating a few short test cases
- Pick an n that is small enough, but not 1 or 2 (or other *unique* cases)
- Mentually determine the answer if possible
- Write out the
    - Pretend that I  are a robot 
    - Walk through the steps of determining how I know those numbers are prime
    - Talk out load about the decisions I'm making
- Manually perform the steps, talk out loud about the decisions
- Write the steps
    - Make sure they are repeatable for every times of output
    -
