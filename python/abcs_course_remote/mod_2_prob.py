Last Factorial Digit
Given a non-negative number, N, return the last digit of the factorial of N.

The factorial of N, which is written as N!, is defined as the product of all of the integers from 1 to N.

Given 3 as N, the factorial is 1 x 2 x 3 = 6
Given 6 as N, the factorial is 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 720
Given 9 as N, the factorial is 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9 = 362,880

Prompt:
You are in charge of a server that needs to run some submitted tasks on a first-come, first-served basis. Each day, you can dedicate the server to run these tasks for at most T minutes. Given the time each task takes, you want to know how many of them will be finished today.

Consider the following example:

Assume T = 180 and the tasks take 

45, 30, 55, 20, 80 and 20 minutes(in the order that they are submitted). Then, only four tasks can be completed. The first four tasks can be completed because they take 150 minutes, but not the first five, because they take 230 minutes which is greater than 180. Notice that although there is enough time to perform the sixth task(which takes 20 minutes) after completing the fourth task, you cannot do that because the fifth task is not done yet.


Input
The input consists of a two lines.

The first line contains two integers n and T.
1 ≤ n ≤ 50 is the number of tasks
1 ≤ T ≤ 500 is the total amount of execution time available.

The second line contains n positive integers, separated by spaces, smaller than 100, indicating how long each task takes in order they are submitted(the same order they must be evaluated in).
1 < n < 100 - the input looks like this:
n n n n n

Output
Display(by printing) the number of tasks that can be completed in T minutes on a first-come, first-served basis.

Prompt:   Roman to Integer
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.


Example 1:
Input: "III"
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: "IV"
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: "IX"
Output: 9

Example 4:
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 5:
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
