# Graphs
- mathematical representations of the data systems
- a graph has a set of vertices and edges
- vertices are lines
- edges are dots that connect the vertices
  - pair (x,y)
## Visual
## Types of graphs
- Simple graphs
  - bidirectional edges
- Directed Graphs: edge going from one vertics to another edge but not the opposite
- Cyclic graph: One cycle or loop in a graph; vertex x back to vertex x
- Acyclic graphs:
  - abosolutely no cycels ex: trees
- DAGs: 
  - acyclic 
  - edges are not necessarily bidirectional

Shortest path problems:
- maps inigation
- Common purpose is to find relai

- Simple BFS
  - double ended queue

Typical BFS uses
- Shortest number of steps
- Trying to get a number of hopes across the network

Typical DFS uses
- Backtracking: when one path doesn't work do another path

For the interview
- Understand how to implement BFS and DFS
