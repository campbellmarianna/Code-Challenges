# Hacker Rank Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mini-max-sum/problem
# Given 5 positive integars Find the minimum and maxium that could be calculated
# by suming 4 of them.
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Output: [10,14]
total = 0
# loop the array
for num in array:
    total += num # keep track of the total
    first_sum = total - # subtract the minimum
# subtract the maxium
# returnt the list
