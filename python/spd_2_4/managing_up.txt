Hi Muhammad! The solution is  2 options. The first option is to delete the Heroku app and try again using `heroku git push dev`. The second option is to delete the Heroku app,  merge all important files into master then create and deploy to Heroku using the master branch.

Reason for the options:
Option 1:
- I cloned your repo and successful deployed your application with no changes to the code. Good Job on setting up the project for deployment. 
  - Proof: https://example-app-mosaic.herokuapp.com/
- As a result of successfully deploying your app on another system I recommend trying it again if you haven't already

Option 2:
- It is best practice to deploy on master because it  is  a separation of concerns  and  ensures you always have a working version 

- I use this article as a reference every time I need to deploy a python program (Flask specificly): https://medium.com/@jasmine.yhumbert/how-to-get-your-flask-app-running-on-heroku-892030811c0f
