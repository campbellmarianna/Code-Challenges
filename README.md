# Technical Interview Prep Sept-Oct 2019
I'm doing a couple things to improve my problem-solving and technical interviewing skills:
- Reading Cracking the Coding Interview
- Doing a [Problem Solving Course](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1578976)  on Canvas

Problems I've done so far:
Remote ABCS: 10 = 5 + 5 
In-person ABCS: 6 = 4 + 2

## 3 things I'm learning everyday
[DAY 1] What is a virtual function? A function in the global scope, a function accessible to other code such as other functions and variables.
Virtual function is the same as a virtual method. In other words it is a method within a class.
- [Virtual function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_function)

[DAY 7] I learned a strategy I can use to solve a problem I've never done before: come up with a few simple test cases, run through them, type out the output at each, talk out loud about the decisions I'm making, when I start to see check if .. and repeated things I know that can be identified as structures (loops and conditionals). After that I can write in statements what I'm doing (as an outline/ pseudocode), taking something out and write more statements for it if need be then translate statements into Python.
- [Python Visualize](http://pythontutor.com)

[DAY 9] To practice a new language one can create the functions, use the statements they read/find in documentation
- [Python Docs for Break](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops)

[DAY 11] Ord() translates individual characters into their ASCII values
- [ASCII Table](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html)

- "Experiment with functions and getting its output, you won't be able to do this during an interview but while your solving problems especially for the first time do worry to try to figure it out in your head, use repl.it that is what is there for." - Liz Howard

[DAY 15] An algorithm has a linear running time when the number of operations only grow in relation to the input. Sets can make filtering data easier because it can search for, add and remove an element in constant time (one operation). Additionally, I can analyze the time complexity for a solution by identifying the lines in the algorithm where the number of operations grow in respect to given input n.
