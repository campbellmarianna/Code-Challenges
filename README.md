# Technical Interview Prep Sept-Oct 2019
I'm doing a couple things to improve my problem-solving and technical interviewing skills:
- Reading Cracking the Coding Interview
- Doing a [Problem Solving Course](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1578976)  on Canvas

## 3 things I'm learning everyday
[DAY 1] What is a virtual function? A function in the global scope, a function accessible to other code such as other functions and variables.
Virtual function is the same as a virtual method. In other words it is a method within a class.
- [Virtual function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_function)

[DAY 7] I learned a strategy I can use to solve a problem I've never done before: come up with a few simple test cases, run through them, type out the output at each, talk out loud about the decisions I'm making, when I start to see check if .. and repeated things I know that can be identified as structures (loops and conditionals). After that I can write in statements what I'm doing (as an outline/ pseudocode), taking something out and write more statements for it if need be then translate statements into Python.

[DAY 9] To practice a new language one create the functions, use the statements they read/find in documentation
- [Python Docs for Break](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops)
