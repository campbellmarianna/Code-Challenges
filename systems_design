Yelp Architecture Interview

Solving this question requires thinking about several topics that you will have to tackle during an architecture interview.
You own a movie browsing app. You want to design a feature where you can share the critical score of a movie on your app. You rely on another company for getting data for these scores.

1. What information would you have to ingest?
- What is being returned from the API

2. How would you obtain this information from the other company?
- Docs
- Open Source

3. How would you save this data?
- Database

4. What kind of issues can you run into when you try to work with another company to fetch data?
- Change API
- Change Inputs and Outputs
- Many risks for dealing with third party software

5. What are considerations you have to make if you want your webpage to be available internationally (lets say some of these scores include written reviews with them)
- I18M (International Standards)

6. How much would this feature cost?
- Dependence if we have developers in house who can write in the language
fluently or not
- Translation should read just as well as English

7. How would you scale this feature? ( Too early because they didn't tell me the requirements)
- Scale it horizontal
- Add more servers

8. How would you assess the success of this features? What would you need to have in place in order to measure that?
- Write test
- Personally test on production
- Run automation test
- Real Time testing to see what users are getting on their end


** Ask Interviewer how can I best prepare (ex: practice questions)**

Tips
- Its good to know how to build it and not know how to build it out in code
- Know what to do when you don't know what to do

Coding Challenge
1. Implement a class that behaves as a generator for generators. (language dependent)
2. You have an array of nodes.  Each node referenced in the array can point to
other nodes. These nodes may or may not be referenced in subsequent elements of this array.
You must return the number of separate graphs/trees that are in this array.
3. Note that each node has a property “data” which is a string that you can set to
any value you like, as well as an array of other nodes that it points to.
4. Elaboration: if the array is of size 5, and there are 5 unconnected graphs,
then each node referenced in the array is either a singular node or a node pointing
to multiple nodes that are not referenced in the given array.
5. There would be less than 5 unconnected graphs  if the node at index 0 in the
array pointed to, or was the same as, the node at index 2 (or any other index for that matter)
